# --No longer in development--
Powercord has reached its End Of Life, effective 25/07/2022. As such, this project does not serve a purpose and the repository has been archived.

# Powercord Utilities
These are a small set of scripts to aid in the management of a Discord+Powercord installation. Sometimes it breaks, at least for me, and I have to reinstall it. Or perhaps I wanted to tweak a theme, and I would have to copy the theme into a hard-to-get-to folder. These annoyances got tiresome, so I wrote two scripts to automate them.
## Contents
* FullReinstall.sh
	
	This script does a few things, as its goal is to make the re/installation of Discord+Powercord as effortless as possible.
	It will wipe folders that it may have previously downloaded, re/download Discord, then Powercord.
	Powercord's plug is then run automatically, followed by the ThemeManager.sh script, then Discord is started.
* ThemeManager.sh
	
	This standalone script allows easy management of themes loaded into Powercord.
	It presents a menu that you can use to select which themes you wish to use from a folder, and then copies them into Powercord.
	If possible, it will offer to re/start Discord at the end of the procedure.
	
## Dependencies
There are a small handful of required packages and libraries for all this to work properly.
### Discord's dependencies:
* `libnss3`
* `libgbm-dev`
